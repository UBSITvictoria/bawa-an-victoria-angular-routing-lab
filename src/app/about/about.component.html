    <p class="text-muted">
        Just a bunch of students trying to survive coding, fueled by caffeine, last-minute Google searches, and sheer determination. Somewhere between debugging and accidental git push --force, we somehow managed to build this Angular project. It’s been a wild ride, but hey, at least it works (we think)!
